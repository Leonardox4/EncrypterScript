# EncrypterScript
This file make the use of gpg to encrypt a file with passwd and lets the user automate it. 
Working:
What it does is it encrypts the file you can also mention the directory and upon encryption it deletes the original file and leaves behind an ecrypted file which later on you can decrypt using the same script, there what it does is it deletes the encrypted file and outputs the original file.
